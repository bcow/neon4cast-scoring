# Example of a CRPS calculation from an ensemble forecast

The following uses Equation 2 in Jordan, Kruger, and Lerch 2018

<!-- ![Equation 1 from Jordan, Kruger, and Lerch 2018.](equation_2.png) -->

First, create a random sample from a probability distribution.  For simplicity,
we will use a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1

```{r}
d <- rnorm(1000, 0.0, 1.0)
```

Second, we have our data point.  We will set it to zero as well
```{r}
y <- 0
```

Now calculate CRPS using Equation 2

```{r}
s <- 0
for(i in 1:length(d)){
  for(j in 1:length(d)){
    s <- s + abs(d[i] - d[j])
  }
}
crps_equation_2 <- mean(abs(d - y)) - s / (2 * length(d)^2)
crps_equation_2
```

Now calculate using the `crps_sample()` function in the `scoringRules` package

```{r}
crps_sample(y = 0, dat = d)
```

# Exploring the scoring surface

Now lets see how the CRPS changes as the mean and standard deviation of the 
forecasted distribution change

First, set vectors for the different mean and SD values we want to explore
```{r}
sample_mean <- seq(-5,5, 0.1)
sample_sd <- seq(0.1,10, 0.1)
```

Second, set our observed value to 0 for simplicity
```{r}
y <- 0
```

Now calculate the crps at each combination of forest mean and SD

```{r, cache = TRUE}
combined <- array(NA, dim = c(length(sample_mean), length(sample_sd)))
for(i in 1:length(sample_mean)){
  for(j in 1:length(sample_sd)){
    sample <- rnorm(10000, sample_mean[i], sample_sd[j])
    combined[i, j] <- crps_sample(y = y, dat = sample)
  }
}
```

Finally, visualize the scoring surface with the observed value represented by 
the red line

```{r}
contour(x = sample_mean, y = sample_sd, z = as.matrix(combined),nlevels = 20, xlab = "Mean", ylab = "SD")
abline(v = y, col = "red")
```

The contour surface highlights the trade-off between the mean and standard deviation.

## CRPS from the Normal Distribution

If the distributional forecast is a normal distribution represented by a mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, an ensemble of predictions is not needed to evaluate CRPS because we can take advantage of the analytic solution to CRPS under the normal assumption (Equation 4 from [Calibrated Probabilistic Forecasting Using Ensemble Model Output Statistics and Minimum CRPS Estimation](https://watermark.silverchair.com/mwr2904_1.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAApgwggKUBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKFMIICgQIBADCCAnoGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM2Yg9u6zpKMkeG-MZAgEQgIICS2FPhx01T-GEC6XR9NW15e3cyFnYzNrvIrWlbGgZLL5mqc2FPqEQU3xP8eFkAdf-93bl3woHtnsYued4wszFf3VYdklPefA_pMhpeK5YhqZuSMVAE_wbNjftZ5oLbghaKSR3fXyQVRC1LNbDR01kIb7-ucoHJeup_vNux8ijTRdAIL7Q0EurOIKt_7EIq7GTI99k9NKrukhvVU5nuduGocalhTWxdHKkhUiIWOqJWPTgnhU-5GGi2PmwrUna2pcLyxEeP_v6savXocS5bzmte6Ypehx4f_ixige9xuTQKV2N7cFuXC_QRVF01PcSnjovff0afdZ62KYcUkTaqYv0Hx3hUXQEWkr9xDqPseo5j4_U_yPBcEib1VMMYVmy4b5r-ZOo3HAMP94-6IuIpJ02DgN4PaENzv-cqEXGGGu09_eVk9rFdJDrUXdMF0qAlduSJPZwZ3T0I-fJn1hBo-GkWcCf_QqzHjz0LzpM_Ud6efoVVQFSF61xIFJfjeoEIt6Ld-xLW_JRafyYueKo1oBG0JTQXypZMSRq8-Vz52nznEdA37Kt96BxIaN3yz3asIoacMpuQHGO9M33WiZ5vK_6iWscs4lg7EWtbiImVhZNDYgoDTfsWeGXqbhlNZHC4X-NCuQEKU2rMemftyxrpSQPb7LowFTARg2n62icDk-gtu6TaHvzee1yiQ_vyPzeYenyEVq3D0bbbt7nkbD_r-jBHEdN3GTUfhAIlLerV4YjWAisQrP5ra7_1bB7lbkpAX6S5tsARgKLlMsT06wN)). 

Equation 5 from [Calibrated Probabilistic Forecasting Using Ensemble Model Output Statistics and Minimum CRPS Estimation](https://watermark.silverchair.com/mwr2904_1.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAApgwggKUBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKFMIICgQIBADCCAnoGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM2Yg9u6zpKMkeG-MZAgEQgIICS2FPhx01T-GEC6XR9NW15e3cyFnYzNrvIrWlbGgZLL5mqc2FPqEQU3xP8eFkAdf-93bl3woHtnsYued4wszFf3VYdklPefA_pMhpeK5YhqZuSMVAE_wbNjftZ5oLbghaKSR3fXyQVRC1LNbDR01kIb7-ucoHJeup_vNux8ijTRdAIL7Q0EurOIKt_7EIq7GTI99k9NKrukhvVU5nuduGocalhTWxdHKkhUiIWOqJWPTgnhU-5GGi2PmwrUna2pcLyxEeP_v6savXocS5bzmte6Ypehx4f_ixige9xuTQKV2N7cFuXC_QRVF01PcSnjovff0afdZ62KYcUkTaqYv0Hx3hUXQEWkr9xDqPseo5j4_U_yPBcEib1VMMYVmy4b5r-ZOo3HAMP94-6IuIpJ02DgN4PaENzv-cqEXGGGu09_eVk9rFdJDrUXdMF0qAlduSJPZwZ3T0I-fJn1hBo-GkWcCf_QqzHjz0LzpM_Ud6efoVVQFSF61xIFJfjeoEIt6Ld-xLW_JRafyYueKo1oBG0JTQXypZMSRq8-Vz52nznEdA37Kt96BxIaN3yz3asIoacMpuQHGO9M33WiZ5vK_6iWscs4lg7EWtbiImVhZNDYgoDTfsWeGXqbhlNZHC4X-NCuQEKU2rMemftyxrpSQPb7LowFTARg2n62icDk-gtu6TaHvzee1yiQ_vyPzeYenyEVq3D0bbbt7nkbD_r-jBHEdN3GTUfhAIlLerV4YjWAisQrP5ra7_1bB7lbkpAX6S5tsARgKLlMsT06wN) gives

$$\begin{align*}
CRPS(N(\mu, \sigma^2) | y) = \sigma \left( \frac{y - \mu}{\sigma} \left( 2 \Phi\left(  \frac{y - \mu}{\sigma} \right) - 1 \right)  + 2 \phi \left(  \frac{y - \mu}{\sigma} \right) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \right)
\end{align*}$$

for $\Phi(\cdot)$ and $\phi(\cdot)$ the standard normal CDF and PDF, respectively. Therefore, if the forecast distribution is **truly** a normal distribution (often this isn't true in forecasts that only report a mean and sd) a simplified score can be applied as follows:

```{r, cache = TRUE}
sample_mean <- seq(-5,5, 0.01)
sample_sd <- seq(0.1,10, 0.01)
combined_norm <- array(NA, dim = c(length(sample_mean), length(sample_sd)))
for(i in 1:length(sample_mean)){
  for(j in 1:length(sample_sd)){
    # sample <- rnorm(10000, sample_mean[i], sample_sd[j])
    combined_norm[i, j] <- crps_norm(y = y, mean = sample_mean[i], sd = sample_sd[j])
  }
}
```

Finally, visualize the scoring surface with the observed value represented by 
the red line

```{r}
contour(x = sample_mean, y = sample_sd, z = as.matrix(combined_norm), nlevels = 20, xlab = "Mean", ylab = "SD")
abline(v = y, col = "red")
```

Note that at a given value of the sd, the lowest score is achieved at $\mu = y$ as shown for each of the blue lines where the minmum value of the score across each blue line is at the red line. This behavior make sense because the CRPS is a score that reward accuracy and precision. Thus, for any given level of precision (represented by the standard deviation), CRPS is optimized by producing the most accurate prediction of the distribution's location.

```{r}
contour(x = sample_mean, y = sample_sd, z = as.matrix(combined_norm), nlevels = 20, xlab = "Mean", ylab = "SD")
abline(v = y, col = "red")
abline(h = 2.5, col = "blue")
abline(h = 4.3, col = "blue")
abline(h = 6.8, col = "blue")
```

Interestingly, for a given mean $\mu \neq y$ we find a pattern that makes intuitive sense given the goal of CRPS to produce forecasts that are both accurate and precise. For a given amount of bias in the prediction (i.e., given a $\mu \neq y$), the optimal score is achieved by a standard deviation that slightly larger than the bias


```{r}
layout(matrix(1:4, 2, 2, byrow = TRUE))
## plots for mu = 2
mu <- 0.2
contour(x = sample_mean, y = sample_sd, z = as.matrix(combined_norm), nlevels = 20, xlab = "Mean", ylab = "SD", main = paste0("CRPS contour given mu = ", mu))
abline(v = mu, col = "red")
min_sd <- sample_sd[which.min(crps_norm(y, mean = mu, sd = sample_sd))]
abline(h = min_sd, col = "blue")
plot(sample_sd, crps_norm(y, mean = mu, sd = sample_sd), type = 'l', main = paste0("CRPS profile given mu = ", mu))
abline(v = min_sd, col = "blue")

## plots for mu = 4
mu <- 4
contour(x = sample_mean, y = sample_sd, z = as.matrix(combined_norm), nlevels = 20, xlab = "Mean", ylab = "SD", main = paste0("CRPS contour given mu = ", mu))
abline(v = mu, col = "red")
min_sd <- sample_sd[which.min(crps_norm(y, mean = mu, sd = sample_sd))]
abline(h = min_sd, col = "blue")
plot(sample_sd, crps_norm(y, mean = mu, sd = sample_sd), type = 'l', main = paste0("CRPS profile given mu = ", mu))
abline(v = min_sd, col = "blue")
```

Next, we plot the relationship between a given value of $\mu$ and the $\sd$ that produces the optimal CRPS. This looks like a linear relationship.

```{r}
optimal_sd <- rep(0, length(sample_mean))
for (i in 1:length(sample_mean)) {
  optimal_sd[i] <- sample_sd[which.min(crps_norm(y, mean = sample_mean[i], sd = sample_sd))]
}
plot(sample_mean, optimal_sd, type = 'l')
```

Let's estimate the slope of the relationship. It looks like the optimal $sd$ for a normal distribution forecast that is biased by $|y - \mu|$ is $sd = 1.2|y - \mu|$ which makes sense as this would put the true value in a region of high probability. 

```{r}
coef(lm(optimal_sd[sample_mean > 0] ~ sample_mean[sample_mean > 0]))
```
